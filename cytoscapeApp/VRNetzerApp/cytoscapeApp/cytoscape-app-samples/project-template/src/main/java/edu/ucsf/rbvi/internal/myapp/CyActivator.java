/**
 * {@code CyActivator} is a class that is a starting point for OSGi bundles.
 * 
 * A quick overview of OSGi: The common currency of OSGi is the <i>service</i>.
 * A service is merely a Java interface, along with objects that implement the
 * interface. OSGi establishes a system of <i>bundles</i>. Most bundles import
 * services. Some bundles export services. Some do both. When a bundle exports a
 * service, it provides an implementation to the service's interface. Bundles
 * import a service by asking OSGi for an implementation. The implementation is
 * provided by some other bundle.
 * 
 * When OSGi starts your bundle, it will invoke {@CyActivator}'s
 * {@code start} method. So, the {@code start} method is where
 * you put in all your code that sets up your app. This is where you import and
 * export services.
 * 
 * Your bundle's {@code Bundle-Activator} manifest entry has a fully-qualified
 * path to this class. It's not necessary to inherit from
 * {@code AbstractCyActivator}. However, we provide this class as a convenience
 * to make it easier to work with OSGi.
 *
 * Note: AbstractCyActivator already provides its own {@code stop} method, which
 * {@code unget}s any services we fetch using getService().
