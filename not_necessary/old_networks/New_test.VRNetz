Can act either as a transcriptional repressor or a transcriptional activator depending on its interactions with other transcription factors, histone acetylases and deacetylases. The suppressive activity of Treg involves the coordinate activation of many genes, including CTLA4 and TNFRSF18 by FOXP3 along with repression of genes encoding cytokines such as interleukin-2 (IL2) and interferon- gamma (IFNG). Inhibits cytokine production and T-cell effector function by repressing the activity of two key transcription factors, RELA and NFATC2.

Regulates p53\/TP53 stability and prolonges its turnover: may act by specifically binding to a methylated from of p53\/TP53; Belongs to the Polycomblike family.","display name":"PHF1","stringdb_structures":["2E5P","2M0O","4HCZ","5XFN","5XFO","5XFP"],"tissue_thyroid gland":1.290323,"target_family":"Epigenetic","tissue_bone marrow":0.854774,"target_development level":"Tbio","compartment_lysosome":1.500651,"tissue_nervous system":4.301879,"compartment_plasma membrane":1.751828,"tissue_bone":1.167429},"354":{"tissue_gall bladder":2.196218,"stringdb_disease score":0.649693,"stringdb_sequence":"MTMTLHTKASGMALLHQIQGNELEPLNRPQLKIPLERPLGEVYLDSSKPAVYNYPEGAAYEFNAAAAANAQVYGQTGLPYGPGSEAAAFGSNGLGGFPPLNSVSPSPLMLLHPPPQLSPFLQPHGQQVPYYLENEPSGYTVREAGPPAFYRPNSDNRRQGGRERLASTNDKGSMAMESAKETRYCAVCNDYASGYHYGVWSCEGCKAFFKRSIQGHNDYMCPATNQCTIDKNRRKSCQACRLRKCYEVGMMKGGIRKDRRGGRMLKHKRQRDDGEGRGEVGSAGDMRAANLWPSPLMIKRSKKNSLALSLTADQMVSALLDAEPPILYSEYDPTRPFSEASMMGLLTNLADRELVHMINWAKRVPGFVDLTLHDQVHLLECAWLEILMIGLVWRSMEHPGKLLFAPNLLLDRNQGKCVEGMVEIFDMLLATSSRFRMMNLQGEEFVCLKSIILLNSGVYTFLSSTLKSLEEKDHIHRVLDKITDTLIHLMAKAGLTLQQQHQRLAQLLLILSHIRHMSNKGMEHLYSMKCKNVVPLYDLLLEMLDAHRLHAPTSRGGASVEETDQSHLATAGSTSSHSLQKYYITGEAEGFPATV","tissue_eye":2.189199,"tissue_saliva":2.129248,"compartment_extracellular":3.086117,"tissue_adrenal gland":2.987871,"tissue_heart":3.069247,"tissue_muscle":3.240431,"stringdb_database identifier":"9606.ENSP00000405330","stringdb_namespace":"stringdb","tissue_intestine":3.241358,"tissue_kidney":3.23007,"stringdb_canonical name":"P03372","tissue_liver":3.730259,"tissue_pancreas":2.752103,"compartment_cytoskeleton":3.177339,"compartment_nucleus":5.0,"node_color":[209, 255, 128],"node_label":"","name":"9606.ENSP00000405330","node_Cytoscape_pos":[-119.57237607782537, -60.757474032315315, 0.0],"tissue_lung":3.252688,"compartment_cytosol":4.616854,"tissue_skin":2.819586,"tissue_urine":2.611813,"stringdb_species":"Homo sapiens","tissue_spleen":2.559751,"compartment_golgi apparatus":5.0,"compartment_endoplasmic reticulum":2.726935,"shared name":"9606.ENSP00000405330","tissue_stomach":2.614588,"SUID":354,"tissue_blood":3.426767,"@id":"stringdb:9606.ENSP00000405330","compartment_mitochondrion":3.043571,"node_size":35.0,"stringdb_enhancedLabel Passthrough":"label: attribute=\"display name\" labelsize=12 labelAlignment=left outline=true outlineColor=white outlineTransparency=95 outlineWidth=10 background=false color=black dropShadow=false","stringdb_node type":"protein","compartment_endosome":2.189728,"stringdb_description":"Nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group A member 1; Nuclear hormone receptor. The steroid hormones and their receptors are involved in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression and affect cellular proliferation and differentiation in target tissues. Ligand-dependent nuclear transactivation involves either direct homodimer binding to a palindromic estrogen response element (ERE) sequence or association with other DNA- binding transcription factors, such as AP-1\/c-Jun, c-Fos, ATF-2, Sp1 and Sp3, to mediate ERE-independent signaling. Ligand binding induces a conformational change allowing subsequent or combinatorial association with multiprotein coactivator complexes through LXXLL motifs of their respective components. Mutual transrepression occurs between the estrogen receptor (ER) and NF- kappa-B in a cell-type specific manner. Decreases NF-kappa-B DNA- binding activity and inhibits NF-kappa-B-mediated transcription from the IL6 promoter and displace RELA\/p65 and associated coregulators from the promoter. Recruited to the NF-kappa-B response element of the CCL2 and IL8 promoters and can displace CREBBP. Present with NF-kappa-B components RELA\/p65 and NFKB1\/p50 on ERE sequences. Can also act synergistically with NF-kappa-B to activate transcription involving respective recruitment adjacent response elements; the function involves CREBBP. Can activate the transcriptional activity of TFF1. Also mediates membrane-initiated estrogen signaling involving various kinase cascades. Isoform 3 is involved in activation of NOS3 and endothelial nitric oxide production. Isoforms lacking one or several functional domains are thought to modulate transcriptional activity by competitive ligand or DNA binding and\/or heterodimerization with the full-length receptor. Essential for MTA1-mediated transcriptional regulation of BRCA1 and BCAS3. Isoform 3 can bind to ERE and inhibit isoform 1.","display name":"ESR1","stringdb_structures":["1A52","1AKF","1ERE","1ERR","1G50","1GWQ","1GWR","1HCP","1HCQ","1L2I","1PCG","1QKT","1QKU","1R5K","1SJ0","1UOM","1X7E","1X7R","1XP1","1XP6","1XP9","1XPC","1XQC","1YIM","1YIN","1ZKY","2AYR","2B1V","2B1Z","2B23","2BJ4","2FAI","2G44","2G5O","2I0J","2IOG","2IOK","2JF9","2JFA","2LLO","2LLQ","2OCF","2OUZ","2P15","2POG","2Q6J","2Q70","2QA6","2QA8","2QAB","2QE4","2QGT","2QGW","2QH6","2QR9","2QSE","2QXM","2QXS","2QZO","2R6W","2R6Y","2YAT","2YJA","3CBM","3CBO","3CBP","3DT3","3ERD","3ERT","3HLV","3HM1","3L03","3OS8","3OS9","3OSA","3Q95","3UU7","3UUA","3UUC","3UUD","4AA6","4DMA","4IU7","4IUI","4IV2","4IV4","4IVW","4IVY","4IW6","4IW8","4IWC","4IWF","4JC3","4JDD","4MG5","4MG6","4MG7","4MG8","4MG9","4MGA","4MGB","4MGC","4MGD","4O6F","4PP6","4PPP","4PPS","4PXM","4Q13","4Q50","4TUZ","4TV1","4XI3","4ZN7","4ZN9","4ZNH","4ZNS","4ZNT","4ZNU","4ZNV","4ZNW","5AAU","5AAV","5ACC","5AK2","5DI7","5DID","5DIE","5DIG","5DK9","5DKB","5DKE","5DKG","5DKS","5DL4","5DLR","5DMC","5DMF","5DP0","5DRJ","5DRM","5DTV","5DU5","5DUE","5DUG","5DUH","5DVS","5DVV","5DWE","5DWG","5DWI","5DWJ","5DX3","5DXB","5DXE","5DXG","5DXK","5DXM","5DXP","5DXQ","5DXR","5DY8","5DYB","5DYD","5DZ0","5DZ1","5DZ3","5DZH","5DZI","5E0W","5E0X","5E14","5E15","5E19","5E1C","5EGV","5EHJ","5EI1","5EIT","5FQP","5FQR","5FQS","5FQT","5FQV","5GS4","5GTR","5HYR","5JMM","5KCC","5KCD","5KCE","5KCF","5KCT","5KCU","5KCW","5KD9","5KR9","5KRA","5KRC","5KRF","5KRH","5KRI","5KRJ","5KRK","5KRL","5KRM","5KRO","5N10","5T0X","5T1Z","5T92","5T97","5TLD","5TLF","5TLG","5TLL","5TLM","5TLO","5TLP","5TLT","5TLU","5TLV","5TLX","5TLY","5TM1","5TM2","5TM3","5TM4","5TM5","5TM6","5TM7","5TM8","5TM9","5TML","5TMM","5TMO","5TMQ","5TMR","5TMS","5TMT","5TMU","5TMV","5TMW","5TMZ","5TN1","5TN3","5TN4","5TN5","5TN6","5TN7","5TN8","5TN9","5TNB","5U2B","5U2D","5UFW","5UFX","5W9C","5W9D","5WGD","5WGQ","6B0F","6C42","6CBZ","6CHW","6CHZ","6CZN","6D0F","6DF6","6DFN","6HHP","6HKB","6HKF","6HMU","6IAR"],"tissue_thyroid gland":3.27899,"compartment_peroxisome":2.366123,"target_family":"NR","tissue_bone marrow":2.699659,"target_development level":"Tclin","compartment_lysosome":2.453018,"tissue_nervous system":3.480775,"compartment_plasma membrane":5.0,"tissue_bone":3.054596},"333":{"tissue_gall bladder":1.066947,"stringdb_disease score":1.214542,"stringdb_sequence":"MCGIFAYMNYRVPRTRKEIFETLIKGLQRLEYRGYDSAGVAIDGNNHEVKERHIQLVKKRGKVKALDEELYKQDSMDLKVEFETHFGIAHTRWATHGVPSAVNSHPQRSDKGNEFVVIHNGIITNYKDLRKFLESKGYEFESETDTETIAKLIKYVFDNRETEDITFSTLVERVIQQLEGAFALVFKSVHYPGEAVATRRGSPLLIGVRSKYKLSTEQIPILYRTCTLENVKNICKTRMKRLDSSACLHAVGDKAVEFFFASDASAIIEHTNRVIFLEDDDIAAVADGKLSIHRVKRSASDDPSRAIQTLQMELQQIMKGNFSAFMQKEIFEQPESVFNTMRGRVNFETNTVLLGGLKDHLKEIRRCRRLIVIGCGTSYHAAVATRQVLEELTELPVMVELASDFLDRNTPVFRDDVCFFISQSGETADTLLALRYCKDRGALTVGVTNTVGSSISRETDCGVHINAGPEIGVASTKAYTSQFISLVMFGLMMSEDRISLQNRRQEIIRGLRSLPELIKEVLSLEEKIHDLALELYTQRSLLVMGRGYNYATCLEGALKIKEITYMHSEGILAGELKHGPLALIDKQMPVIMVIMKDPCFAKCQNALQQVTARQGRPIILCSKDDTESSKFAYKTIELPHTVDCLQGILSVIPLQLLSFHLAVLRGYDVDFPRNLAKSVTVE","tissue_eye":1.93903,"tissue_saliva":1.393514,"compartment_extracellular":1.666639,"tissue_adrenal gland":1.928334,"tissue_heart":2.785892,"tissue_muscle":2.533005,"stringdb_database identifier":"9606.ENSP00000253778","stringdb_namespace":"stringdb","tissue_intestine":2.735158,"tissue_kidney":4.509771,"stringdb_canonical name":"O94808","tissue_liver":3.167199,"tissue_pancreas":2.621804,"compartment_cytoskeleton":1.655497,"compartment_nucleus":2.331946,"node_color":[0, 185, 255],"node_label":"","name":"9606.ENSP00000253778","node_Cytoscape_pos":[458.69031541997737, 240.69040194424718, 0.0],"tissue_lung":2.257157,"compartment_cytosol":4.461226,"tissue_skin":2.180549,"tissue_urine":1.293822,"stringdb_species":"Homo sapiens","tissue_spleen":1.273695,"compartment_golgi apparatus":1.344553,"compartment_endoplasmic reticulum":1.785404,"shared name":"9606.ENSP00000253778","tissue_stomach":1.916352,"SUID":333,"tissue_blood":2.323637,"@id":"stringdb:9606.ENSP00000253778","compartment_mitochondrion":2.497967,"node_size":35.0,"stringdb_enhancedLabel Passthrough":"label: attribute=\"display name\" labelsize=12 labelAlignment=left outline=true outlineColor=white outlineTransparency=95 outlineWidth=10 background=false color=black dropShadow=false","stringdb_node type":"protein","compartment_endosome":0.755746,"stringdb_description":"Glutamine--fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase [isomerizing] 2; Controls the flux of glucose into the hexosamine pathway.

Undergoes a functional cycle that is linked to its ATPase activity which is essential for its chaperone activity. This cycle probably induces conformational changes in the client proteins, thereby causing their activation. Interacts dynamically with various co-chaperones that modulate its substrate recognition, ATPase cycle and chaperone function. Engages with a range of client protein classes via its interaction with various co-chaperone proteins or complexes, that act as adapters, simultaneously able to interact with the specific client and the central chaperone itself. Recruitment of ATP and co-chaperone followed by client protein forms a functional chaperone. After the completion of the chaperoning process, properly folded client protein and co-chaperone leave HSP90 in an ADP-bound partially open conformation and finally, ADP is released from HSP90 which acquires an open conformation for the next cycle. Apart from its chaperone activity, it also plays a role in the regulation of the transcription machinery. HSP90 and its co-chaperones modulate transcription at least at three different levels. In the first place, they alter the steady-state levels of certain transcription factors in response to various physiological cues. Second, they modulate the activity of certain epigenetic modifiers, such as histone deacetylases or DNA methyl transferases, and thereby respond to the change in the environment. Third, they participate in the eviction of histones from the promoter region of certain genes and thereby turn on gene expression.
