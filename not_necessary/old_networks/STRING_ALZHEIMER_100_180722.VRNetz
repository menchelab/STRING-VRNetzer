This is mediated through serine and\/or threonine phosphorylation of a range of downstream substrates. Over 100 substrate candidates have been reported so far, but for most of them, no isoform specificity has been reported. AKT is responsible of the regulation of glucose uptake by mediating insulin-induced translocation of the SLC2A4\/GLUT4 glucose transporter to the cell surface. Phosphorylation of PTPN1 at 'Ser-50' negatively modulates its phosphatase activity preventing dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor and the attenuation of insulin signaling. Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 triggers the binding of this effector to inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins, which is required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport. AKT regulates also the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen by phosphorylating GSK3A at 'Ser-21' and GSK3B at 'Ser-9', resulting in inhibition of its kinase activity. Phosphorylation of GSK3 isoforms by AKT is also thought to be one mechanism by which cell proliferation is driven. AKT regulates also cell survival via the phosphorylation of MAP3K5 (apoptosis signal-related kinase). Phosphorylation of 'Ser-83' decreases MAP3K5 kinase activity stimulated by oxidative stress and thereby prevents apoptosis. AKT mediates insulin-stimulated protein synthesis by phosphorylating TSC2 at 'Ser-939' and 'Thr-1462', thereby activating mTORC1 signaling and leading to both phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and in activation of RPS6KB1. AKT is involved in the phosphorylation of members of the FOXO factors (Forkhead family of transcription factors), leading to binding of 14-3-3 proteins and cytoplasmic localization. In particular, FOXO1 is phosphorylated at 'Thr-24', 'Ser-256' and 'Ser-319'. FOXO3 and FOXO4 are phosphorylated on equivalent sites. AKT has an important role in the regulation of NF-kappa-B-dependent gene transcription and positively regulates the activity of CREB1 (cyclic AMP (cAMP)- response element binding protein). The phosphorylation of CREB1 induces the binding of accessory proteins that are necessary for the transcription of pro-survival genes such as BCL2 and MCL1. AKT phosphorylates 'Ser-454' on ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), thereby potentially regulating ACLY activity and fatty acid synthesis. Activates the 3B isoform of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE3B) via phosphorylation of 'Ser-273', resulting in reduced cyclic AMP levels and inhibition of lipolysis. Phosphorylates PIKFYVE on 'Ser-318', which results in increased PI(3)P-5 activity. The Rho GTPase-activating protein DLC1 is another substrate and its phosphorylation is implicated in the regulation cell proliferation and cell growth. AKT plays a role as key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation. Signals downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K) to mediate the effects of various growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). AKT mediates the antiapoptotic effects of IGF-I. Essential for the SPATA13-mediated regulation of cell migration and adhesion assembly and disassembly. May be involved in the regulation of the placental development. Phosphorylates STK4\/MST1 at 'Thr-120' and 'Thr-387' leading to inhibition of its: kinase activity, nuclear translocation, autophosphorylation and ability to phosphorylate FOXO3. Phosphorylates STK3\/MST2 at 'Thr- 117' and 'Thr-384' leading to inhibition of its: cleavage, kinase activity, autophosphorylation at Thr-180, binding to RASSF1 and nuclear translocation. Phosphorylates SRPK2 and enhances its kinase activity towards SRSF2 and ACIN1 and promotes its nuclear translocation. Phosphorylates RAF1 at 'Ser-259' and negatively regulates its activity.

NF- kappa-B is a homo- or heterodimeric complex formed by the Rel-like domain-containing proteins RELA\/p65, RELB, NFKB1\/p105, NFKB1\/p50, REL and NFKB2\/p52. The dimers bind at kappa-B sites in the DNA of their target genes and the individual dimers have distinct preferences for different kappa-B sites that they can bind with distinguishable affinity and specificity. Different dimer combinations act as transcriptional activators or repressors, respectively. NF-kappa-B is controlled by various mechanisms of post-translational modification and subcellular compartmentalization as well as by interactions with other cofactors or corepressors. NF-kappa-B complexes are held in the cytoplasm in an inactive state complexed with members of the NF- kappa-B inhibitor (I-kappa-B) family. In a conventional activation pathway, I-kappa-B is phosphorylated by I-kappa-B kinases (IKKs) in response to different activators, subsequently degraded thus liberating the active NF-kappa-B complex which translocates to the nucleus. NF-kappa-B heterodimeric RelB-p50 and RelB-p52 complexes are transcriptional activators. RELB neither associates with DNA nor with RELA\/p65 or REL. Stimulates promoter activity in the presence of NFKB2\/p49. As a member of the NUPR1\/RELB\/IER3 survival pathway, may provide pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with remarkable resistance to cell stress, such as starvation or gemcitabine treatment. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing the transcriptional activator activity of the CLOCK-ARNTL\/BMAL1 heterodimer in a CRY1\/CRY2 independent manner. Increased repression of the heterodimer is seen in the presence of NFKB2\/p52.

Regulates several neuronal development and physiological processes including neuronal survival, migration and differentiation, axonal and neurite growth, synaptogenesis, oligodendrocyte differentiation, synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission, by phosphorylating key proteins. Activated by interaction with CDK5R1 (p35) and CDK5R2 (p39), especially in post-mitotic neurons, and promotes CDK5R1 (p35) expression in an autostimulation loop. Phosphorylates many downstream substrates such as Rho and Ras family small GTPases (e.g. PAK1, RAC1, RHOA, CDC42) or microtubule-binding proteins (e.g. MAPT\/TAU, MAP2, MAP1B), and modulates actin dynamics to regulate neurite growth and\/or spine morphogenesis. Phosphorylates also exocytosis associated proteins such as MCAM\/MUC18, SEPT5, SYN1, and CDK16\/PCTAIRE1 as well as endocytosis associated proteins such as DNM1, AMPH and SYNJ1 at synaptic terminals. In the mature central nervous system (CNS), regulates neurotransmitter movements by phosphorylating substrates associated with neurotransmitter release and synapse plasticity; synaptic vesicle exocytosis, vesicles fusion with the presynaptic membrane, and endocytosis. Promotes cell survival by activating anti-apoptotic proteins BCL2 and STAT3, and negatively regulating of JNK3\/MAPK10 activity. Phosphorylation of p53\/TP53 in response to genotoxic and oxidative stresses enhances its stabilization by preventing ubiquitin ligase-mediated proteasomal degradation, and induces transactivation of p53\/TP53 target genes, thus regulating apoptosis. Phosphorylation of p35\/CDK5R1 enhances its stabilization by preventing calpain-mediated proteolysis producing p25\/CDK5R1 and avoiding ubiquitin ligase-mediated proteasomal degradation. During aberrant cell-cycle activity and DNA damage, p25\/CDK5 activity elicits cell-cycle activity and double-strand DNA breaks that precedes neuronal death by deregulating HDAC1. DNA damage triggered phosphorylation of huntingtin\/HTT in nuclei of neurons protects neurons against polyglutamine expansion as well as DNA damage mediated toxicity. Phosphorylation of PXN reduces its interaction with PTK2\/FAK1 in matrix-cell focal adhesions (MCFA) during oligodendrocytes (OLs) differentiation. Negative regulator of Wnt\/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Activator of the GAIT (IFN-gamma-activated inhibitor of translation) pathway, which suppresses expression of a post-transcriptional regulon of proinflammatory genes in myeloid cells; phosphorylates the linker domain of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) in a IFN-gamma- dependent manner, the initial event in assembly of the GAIT complex. Phosphorylation of SH3GLB1 is required for autophagy induction in starved neurons. Phosphorylation of TONEBP\/NFAT5 in response to osmotic stress mediates its rapid nuclear localization. MEF2 is inactivated by phosphorylation in nucleus in response to neurotoxin, thus leading to neuronal apoptosis. APEX1 AP-endodeoxyribonuclease is repressed by phosphorylation, resulting in accumulation of DNA damage and contributing to neuronal death. NOS3 phosphorylation down regulates NOS3-derived nitrite (NO) levels. SRC phosphorylation mediates its ubiquitin- dependent degradation and thus leads to cytoskeletal reorganization. May regulate endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis via the modulation of lamellipodia formation. Involved in dendritic spine morphogenesis by mediating the EFNA1- EPHA4 signaling. The complex p35\/CDK5 participates in the regulation of the circadian clock by modulating the function of CLOCK protein: phosphorylates CLOCK at 'Thr-451' and 'Thr-461' and regulates the transcriptional activity of the CLOCK-ARNTL\/BMAL1 heterodimer in association with altered stability and subcellular distribution.","display name":"CDK5","stringdb_structures":["1H4L","1LFR","1UNG","1UNH","1UNL","3O0G","4AU8"],"tissue_thyroid gland":2.058053,"compartment_peroxisome":1.520468,"target_family":"Kinase","tissue_bone marrow":1.928301,"target_development level":"Tchem","compartment_lysosome":2.151129,"tissue_nervous system":4.88853,"compartment_plasma membrane":4.527309,"tissue_bone":1.793048},"498":{"tissue_gall bladder":2.565196,"stringdb_disease score":3.095981,"stringdb_sequence":"MLLLADMDVVNQLVAGGQFRVVKEPLGFVKVLQWVFAIFAFATCGSYSGELQLSVDCANKTESDLSIEVEFEYPFRLHQVYFDAPTCRGGTTKVFLVGDYSSSAEFFVTVAVFAFLYSMGALATYIFLQNKYRENNKGPMLDFLATAVFAFMWLVSSSAWAKGLSDVKMATDPENIIKEMPVCRQTGNTCKELRDPVTSGLNTSVVFGFLNLVLWVGNLWFVFKETGWAAPFLRAPPGAPEKQPAPGDAYGDAGYGQGPGGYGPQDSYGPQGGYQPDYGQPAGSGGSGYGPQGDYGQQGYGPQGAPTSFSNQM","tissue_eye":3.477209,"tissue_saliva":2.284523,"compartment_extracellular":2.735557,"tissue_adrenal gland":3.467278,"tissue_heart":2.356789,"tissue_muscle":2.844385,"stringdb_database identifier":"9606.ENSP00000263233","stringdb_namespace":"stringdb","tissue_intestine":3.44673,"tissue_kidney":2.795655,"stringdb_canonical name":"P08247","tissue_liver":2.749646,"tissue_pancreas":3.438349,"compartment_cytoskeleton":3.372771,"compartment_nucleus":3.034863,"node_color":[128, 255, 140],"node_label":"SYP","name":"9606.ENSP00000263233","node_Cytoscape_pos":[-22.238594837188714, 54.979757690429665, 0.0],"tissue_lung":2.982934,"compartment_cytosol":2.418774,"tissue_skin":2.637051,"tissue_urine":2.402542,"stringdb_species":"Homo sapiens","tissue_spleen":2.021124,"compartment_golgi apparatus":2.03939,"compartment_endoplasmic reticulum":2.084745,"shared name":"9606.ENSP00000263233","tissue_stomach":2.920944,"SUID":498,"tissue_blood":2.774169,"@id":"stringdb:9606.ENSP00000263233","compartment_mitochondrion":2.462007,"node_size":35.0,"stringdb_enhancedLabel Passthrough":"label: attribute=\"display name\" labelsize=12 labelAlignment=left outline=true outlineColor=white outlineTransparency=95 outlineWidth=10 background=false color=black dropShadow=false","stringdb_node type":"protein","compartment_endosome":2.129636,"stringdb_description":"Major synaptic vesicle protein p38; Possibly involved in structural functions as organizing other membrane components or in targeting the vesicles to the plasma membrane.

Thus, functions as a protein deglycase that repairs methylglyoxal- and glyoxal-glycated proteins, and releases repaired proteins and lactate or glycolate, respectively. Deglycates cysteine, arginine and lysine residues in proteins, and thus reactivates these proteins by reversing glycation by glyoxals. Acts on early glycation intermediates (hemithioacetals and aminocarbinols), preventing the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) that cause irreversible damage. Also functions as a nucleotide deglycase able to repair glycated guanine in the free nucleotide pool (GTP, GDP, GMP, dGTP) and in DNA and RNA. Is thus involved in a major nucleotide repair system named guanine glycation repair (GG repair), dedicated to reversing methylglyoxal and glyoxal damage via nucleotide sanitization and direct nucleic acid repair. Also displays an apparent glyoxalase activity that in fact reflects its deglycase activity. Plays an important role in cell protection against oxidative stress and cell death acting as oxidative stress sensor and redox-sensitive chaperone and protease; functions probably related to its primary function. It is involved in neuroprotective mechanisms like the stabilization of NFE2L2 and PINK1 proteins, male fertility as a positive regulator of androgen signaling pathway as well as cell growth and transformation through, for instance, the modulation of NF-kappa-B signaling pathway.

Plays a role in regulating expression or stability of the mitochondrial uncoupling proteins SLC25A14 and SLC25A27 in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta and attenuates the oxidative stress induced by calcium entry into the neurons via L-type channels during pacemaking. Regulates astrocyte inflammatory responses, may modulate lipid rafts-dependent endocytosis in astrocytes and neuronal cells. In pancreatic islets, involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and glucose homeostasis in an age- and diet dependent manner. Protects pancreatic beta cells from cell death induced by inflammatory and cytotoxic setting (By similarity). Binds to a number of mRNAs containing multiple copies of GG or CC motifs and partially inhibits their translation but dissociates following oxidative stress. Metal- binding protein able to bind copper as well as toxic mercury ions, enhances the cell protection mechanism against induced metal toxicity. In macrophages, interacts with the NADPH oxidase subunit NCF1 to direct NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS production, and protects against sepsis (By similarity); Belongs to the peptidase C56 family.","display name":"PARK7","stringdb_structures":["1J42","1P5F","1PDV","1PDW","1PE0","1Q2U","1SOA","1UCF","2OR3","2R1T","2R1U","2R1V","2RK3","2RK4","2RK6","3B36","3B38","3B3A","3BWE","3CY6","3CYF","3CZ9","3CZA","3EZG","3F71","3SF8","4BTE","4MNT","4MTC","4N0M","4N12","4OGF","4OQ4","4P2G","4P34","4P35","4P36","4RKW","4RKY","4S0Z","4ZGG","5IP5","5SY6","5SY9","5SYA","6AF5","6AF7","6AF9","6AFA","6AFB","6AFC","6AFD","6AFE","6AFF","6AFG","6AFH","6AFI","6AFJ","6AFL","6E5Z","6M8Z"],"tissue_thyroid gland":3.021757,"compartment_peroxisome":1.73425,"target_family":"Enzyme","tissue_bone marrow":2.824829,"target_development level":"Tbio","compartment_lysosome":2.555783,"tissue_nervous system":4.97356,"compartment_plasma membrane":3.920271,"tissue_bone":1.650088},"378":{"tissue_gall bladder":3.181862,"stringdb_disease score":4.566551,"stringdb_sequence":"MWQLWASLCCLLVLANARSRPSFHPLSDELVNYVNKRNTTWQAGHNFYNVDMSYLKRLCGTFLGGPKPPQRVMFTEDLKLPASFDAREQWPQCPTIKEIRDQGSCGSCWAFGAVEAISDRICIHTNAHVSVEVSAEDLLTCCGSMCGDGCNGGYPAEAWNFWTRKGLVSGGLYESHVGCRPYSIPPCEHHVNGSRPPCTGEGDTPKCSKICEPGYSPTYKQDKHYGYNSYSVSNSEKDIMAEIYKNGPVEGAFSVYSDFLLYKSGVYQHVTGEMMGGHAIRILGWGVENGTPYWLVANSWNTDWGDNGFFKILRGQDHCGIESEVVAGIPRTDQYWEKI","tissue_eye":4.391335,"tissue_saliva":3.302784,"compartment_extracellular":4.774749,"tissue_adrenal gland":3.375016,"tissue_heart":3.852406,"tissue_muscle":3.772493,"stringdb_database identifier":"9606.ENSP00000345672","stringdb_namespace":"stringdb","tissue_intestine":4.602221,"tissue_kidney":4.515715,"stringdb_canonical name":"P07858","tissue_liver":4.935537,"tissue_pancreas":4.518381,"compartment_cytoskeleton":2.593178,"compartment_nucleus":3.683901,"node_color":[191, 128, 255],"node_label":"CTSB","name":"9606.ENSP00000345672","node_Cytoscape_pos":[-0.4680870246887139, -134.00657043457034, 0.0],"tissue_lung":4.687404,"compartment_cytosol":2.972762,"tissue_skin":4.775681,"tissue_urine":3.12608,"stringdb_species":"Homo sapiens","tissue_spleen":3.866031,"compartment_golgi apparatus":2.29733,"compartment_endoplasmic reticulum":2.486313,"shared name":"9606.ENSP00000345672","tissue_stomach":3.715729,"SUID":378,"tissue_blood":4.659744,"@id":"stringdb:9606.ENSP00000345672","compartment_mitochondrion":2.737585,"node_size":35.0,"stringdb_enhancedLabel Passthrough":"label: attribute=\"display name\" labelsize=12 labelAlignment=left outline=true outlineColor=white outlineTransparency=95 outlineWidth=10 background=false color=black dropShadow=false","stringdb_node type":"protein","compartment_endosome":4.605406,"stringdb_description":"APP secretase; Thiol protease which is believed to participate in intracellular degradation and turnover of proteins.

Mediates monoubiquitination as well as 'Lys-6', 'Lys-11', 'Lys-48'-linked and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of substrates depending on the context. Participates in the removal and\/or detoxification of abnormally folded or damaged protein by mediating 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of misfolded proteins such as PARK7: 'Lys-63'- linked polyubiquitinated misfolded proteins are then recognized by HDAC6, leading to their recruitment to aggresomes, followed by degradation. Mediates 'Lys-63'- linked polyubiquitination of a 22 kDa O-linked glycosylated isoform of SNCAIP, possibly playing a role in Lewy-body formation. Mediates monoubiquitination of BCL2, thereby acting as a positive regulator of autophagy. Promotes the autophagic degradation of dysfunctional depolarized mitochondria (mitophagy) by promoting the ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins such as TOMM20, RHOT1\/MIRO1 and USP30. Preferentially assembles 'Lys-6'-, 'Lys-11'- and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains following mitochondrial damage, leading to mitophagy. Mediates 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination of ZNF746, followed by degradation of ZNF746 by the proteasome; possibly playing a role in the regulation of neuron death. Limits the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Regulates cyclin-E during neuronal apoptosis. In collaboration with CHPF isoform 2, may enhance cell viability and protect cells from oxidative stress. Independently of its ubiquitin ligase activity, protects from apoptosis by the transcriptional repression of p53\/TP53. May protect neurons against alpha synuclein toxicity, proteasomal dysfunction, GPR37 accumulation, and kainate-induced excitotoxicity. May play a role in controlling neurotransmitter trafficking at the presynaptic terminal and in calcium-dependent exocytosis.

Can modulate chromatin function through deacetylation of histones and can promote alterations in the methylation of histones and DNA, leading to transcriptional repression. Deacetylates a broad range of transcription factors and coregulators, thereby regulating target gene expression positively and negatively. Serves as a sensor of the cytosolic ratio of NAD(+)\/NADH which is altered by glucose deprivation and metabolic changes associated with caloric restriction. Is essential in skeletal muscle cell differentiation and in response to low nutrients mediates the inhibitory effect on skeletal myoblast differentiation which also involves 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). Component of the eNoSC (energy-dependent nucleolar silencing) complex, a complex that mediates silencing of rDNA in response to intracellular energy status and acts by recruiting histone-modifying enzymes. The eNoSC complex is able to sense the energy status of cell: upon glucose starvation, elevation of NAD(+)\/NADP(+) ratio activates SIRT1, leading to histone H3 deacetylation followed by dimethylation of H3 at 'Lys-9' (H3K9me2) by SUV39H1 and the formation of silent chromatin in the rDNA locus. Deacetylates 'Lys-266' of SUV39H1, leading to its activation. Inhibits skeletal muscle differentiation by deacetylating PCAF and MYOD1. Deacetylates H2A and 'Lys-26' of HIST1H1E. Deacetylates 'Lys-16' of histone H4 (in vitro). Involved in NR0B2\/SHP corepression function through chromatin remodeling: Recruited to LRH1 target gene promoters by NR0B2\/SHP thereby stimulating histone H3 and H4 deacetylation leading to transcriptional repression. Proposed to contribute to genomic integrity via positive regulation of telomere length; however, reports on localization to pericentromeric heterochromatin are conflicting. Proposed to play a role in constitutive heterochromatin (CH) formation and\/or maintenance through regulation of the available pool of nuclear SUV39H1. Upon oxidative\/metabolic stress decreases SUV39H1 degradation by inhibiting SUV39H1 polyubiquitination by MDM2. This increase in SUV39H1 levels enhances SUV39H1 turnover in CH, which in turn seems to accelerate renewal of the heterochromatin which correlates with greater genomic integrity during stress response. Deacetylates 'Lys-382' of p53\/TP53 and impairs its ability to induce transcription-dependent proapoptotic program and modulate cell senescence. Deacetylates TAF1B and thereby represses rDNA transcription by the RNA polymerase I. Deacetylates MYC, promotes the association of MYC with MAX and decreases MYC stability leading to compromised transformational capability. Deacetylates FOXO3 in response to oxidative stress thereby increasing its ability to induce cell cycle arrest and resistance to oxidative stress but inhibiting FOXO3-mediated induction of apoptosis transcriptional activity; also leading to FOXO3 ubiquitination and protesomal degradation. Appears to have a similar effect on MLLT7\/FOXO4 in regulation of transcriptional activity and apoptosis. Deacetylates DNMT1; thereby impairs DNMT1 methyltransferase-independent transcription repressor activity, modulates DNMT1 cell cycle regulatory function and DNMT1-mediated gene silencing. Deacetylates RELA\/NF-kappa-B p65 thereby inhibiting its transactivating potential and augments apoptosis in response to TNF-alpha. Deacetylates HIF1A, KAT5\/TIP60, RB1 and HIC1. Deacetylates FOXO1 resulting in its nuclear retention and enhancement of its transcriptional activity leading to increased gluconeogenesis in liver. Inhibits E2F1 transcriptional activity and apoptotic function, possibly by deacetylation. Involved in HES1- and HEY2-mediated transcriptional repression. In cooperation with MYCN seems to be involved in transcriptional repression of DUSP6\/MAPK3 leading to MYCN stabilization by phosphorylation at 'Ser-62'. Deacetylates MEF2D. Required for antagonist-mediated transcription suppression of AR-dependent genes which may be linked to local deacetylation of histone H3. Represses HNF1A- mediated transcription. Required for the repression of ESRRG by CREBZF. Modulates AP-1 transcription factor activity. Deacetylates NR1H3 AND NR1H2 and deacetylation of NR1H3 at 'Lys-434' positively regulates transcription of NR1H3:RXR target genes, promotes NR1H3 proteosomal degradation and results in cholesterol efflux; a promoter clearing mechanism after reach round of transcription is proposed. Involved in lipid metabolism. Implicated in regulation of adipogenesis and fat mobilization in white adipocytes by repression of PPARG which probably involves association with NCOR1 and SMRT\/NCOR2. Deacetylates ACSS2 leading to its activation, and HMGCS1. Involved in liver and muscle metabolism. Through deacteylation and activation of PPARGC1A is required to activate fatty acid oxidation in skeletel muscle under low-glucose conditions and is involved in glucose homeostasis. Involved in regulation of PPARA and fatty acid beta-oxidation in liver. Involved in positive regulation of insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells in response to glucose; the function seems to imply transcriptional repression of UCP2. Proposed to deacetylate IRS2 thereby facilitating its insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Deacetylates SREBF1 isoform SREBP-1C thereby decreasing its stability and transactivation in lipogenic gene expression. Involved in DNA damage response by repressing genes which are involved in DNA repair, such as XPC and TP73, deacetylating XRCC6\/Ku70, and faciliting recruitment of additional factors to sites of damaged DNA, such as SIRT1-deacetylated NBN can recruit ATM to initiate DNA repair and SIRT1-deacetylated XPA interacts with RPA2. Also involved in DNA repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination and specifically single-strand annealing independently of XRCC6\/Ku70 and NBN. Transcriptional suppression of XPC probably involves an E2F4:RBL2 suppressor complex and protein kinase B (AKT) signaling. Transcriptional suppression of TP73 probably involves E2F4 and PCAF. Deacetylates WRN thereby regulating its helicase and exonuclease activities and regulates WRN nuclear translocation in response to DNA damage. Deacetylates APEX1 at 'Lys-6' and 'Lys-7' and stimulates cellular AP endonuclease activity by promoting the association of APEX1 to XRCC1. Increases p53\/TP53-mediated transcription-independent apoptosis by blocking nuclear translocation of cytoplasmic p53\/TP53 and probably redirecting it to mitochondria. Deacetylates XRCC6\/Ku70 at 'Lys-539' and 'Lys-542' causing it to sequester BAX away from mitochondria thereby inhibiting stress-induced apoptosis. Is involved in autophagy, presumably by deacetylating ATG5, ATG7 and MAP1LC3B\/ATG8. Deacetylates AKT1 which leads to enhanced binding of AKT1 and PDK1 to PIP3 and promotes their activation. Proposed to play role in regulation of STK11\/LBK1- dependent AMPK signaling pathways implicated in cellular senescence which seems to involve the regulation of the acetylation status of STK11\/LBK1. Can deacetylate STK11\/LBK1 and thereby increase its activity, cytoplasmic localization and association with STRAD; however, the relevance of such activity in normal cells is unclear. In endothelial cells is shown to inhibit STK11\/LBK1 activity and to promote its degradation. Deacetylates SMAD7 at 'Lys-64' and 'Lys-70' thereby promoting its degradation. Deacetylates CIITA and augments its MHC class II transactivation and contributes to its stability. Deacteylates MECOM\/EVI1. Deacetylates PML at 'Lys-487' and this deacetylation promotes PML control of PER2 nuclear localization. During the neurogenic transition, repress selective NOTCH1-target genes through histone deacetylation in a BCL6-dependent manner and leading to neuronal differentiation. Regulates the circadian expression of several core clock genes, including ARNTL\/BMAL1, RORC, PER2 and CRY1 and plays a critical role in maintaining a controlled rhythmicity in histone acetylation, thereby contributing to circadian chromatin remodeling. Deacetylates ARNTL\/BMAL1 and histones at the circadian gene promoters in order to facilitate repression by inhibitory components of the circadian oscillator. Deacetylates PER2, facilitating its ubiquitination and degradation by the proteosome. Protects cardiomyocytes against palmitate-induced apoptosis. Deacetylates XBP1 isoform 2; deacetylation decreases protein stability of XBP1 isoform 2 and inhibits its transcriptional activity. Involved in the CCAR2- mediated regulation of PCK1 and NR1D1. Deacetylates CTNB1 at 'Lys-49'.

Requires primed phosphorylation of the majority of its substrates. In skeletal muscle, contributes to insulin regulation of glycogen synthesis by phosphorylating and inhibiting GYS1 activity and hence glycogen synthesis. May also mediate the development of insulin resistance by regulating activation of transcription factors. Regulates protein synthesis by controlling the activity of initiation factor 2B (EIF2BE\/EIF2B5) in the same manner as glycogen synthase. In Wnt signaling, GSK3B forms a multimeric complex with APC, AXIN1 and CTNNB1\/beta-catenin and phosphorylates the N-terminus of CTNNB1 leading to its degradation mediated by ubiquitin\/proteasomes. Phosphorylates JUN at sites proximal to its DNA-binding domain, thereby reducing its affinity for DNA. Phosphorylates NFATC1\/NFATC on conserved serine residues promoting NFATC1\/NFATC nuclear export, shutting off NFATC1\/NFATC gene regulation, and thereby opposing the action of calcineurin. Phosphorylates MAPT\/TAU on 'Thr-548', decreasing significantly MAPT\/TAU ability to bind and stabilize microtubules. MAPT\/TAU is the principal component of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease. Plays an important role in ERBB2-dependent stabilization of microtubules at the cell cortex. Phosphorylates MACF1, inhibiting its binding to microtubules which is critical for its role in bulge stem cell migration and skin wound repair. Probably regulates NF-kappa-B (NFKB1) at the transcriptional level and is required for the NF-kappa-B-mediated anti-apoptotic response to TNF-alpha (TNF\/TNFA). Negatively regulates replication in pancreatic beta-cells, resulting in apoptosis, loss of beta-cells and diabetes. Through phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL1, may control cell apoptosis in response to growth factors deprivation. Phosphorylates MUC1 in breast cancer cells, decreasing the interaction of MUC1 with CTNNB1\/beta-catenin. Is necessary for the establishment of neuronal polarity and axon outgrowth. Phosphorylates MARK2, leading to inhibit its activity. Phosphorylates SIK1 at 'Thr-182', leading to sustain its activity. Phosphorylates ZC3HAV1 which enhances its antiviral activity. Phosphorylates SNAI1, leading to its BTRC-triggered ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Phosphorylates SFPQ at 'Thr-687' upon T-cell activation. Phosphorylates NR1D1 st 'Ser-55' and 'Ser-59' and stabilizes it by protecting it from proteasomal degradation. Regulates the circadian clock via phosphorylation of the major clock components including ARNTL\/BMAL1, CLOCK and PER2. Phosphorylates CLOCK AT 'Ser-427' and targets it for proteasomal degradation. Phosphorylates ARNTL\/BMAL1 at 'Ser-17' and 'Ser-21' and primes it for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Phosphorylates OGT at 'Ser-3' or 'Ser-4' which positively regulates its activity. Phosphorylates MYCN in neuroblastoma cells which may promote its degradation; Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. CMGC Ser\/Thr protein kinase family. GSK-3 subfamily.","display name":"GSK3B","stringdb_structures":["1GNG","1H8F","1I09","1J1B","1J1C","1O6K","1O6L","1O9U","1PYX","1Q3D","1Q3W","1Q41","1Q4L","1Q5K","1R0E","1UV5","2JDO","2JDR","2JLD","2O5K","2OW3","2UW9","2X39","2XH5","3CQU","3CQW","3DU8","3E87","3E88","3E8D","3F7Z","3F88","3GB2","3I4B","3L1S","3M1S","3MV5","3OW4","3PUP","3Q3B","3QKK","3SAY","3SD0","3ZDI","3ZRK","3ZRL","3ZRM","4ACC","4ACD","4ACG","4ACH","4AFJ","4B7T","4DIT","4EKK","4IQ6","4J1R","4J71","4NM0","4NM3","4NM5","4NM7","4PTC","4PTE","4PTG","5F94","5F95","5HLN","5HLP","5K5N","5KPK","5KPL","5KPM","5OY4","5T31","6B8J","6BUU","6GJO","6GN1","6H0U","6NPZ"],"tissue_thyroid gland":2.615012,"compartment_peroxisome":1.721747,"target_family":"Kinase","tissue_bone marrow":2.677846,"target_development level":"Tclin","compartment_lysosome":2.160784,"tissue_nervous system":4.170681,"compartment_plasma membrane":5.0,"tissue_bone":2.328789},"435":{"tissue_gall bladder":2.479935,"stringdb_disease score":3.234363,"stringdb_sequence":"MENTENSVDSKSIKNLEPKIIHGSESMDSGISLDNSYKMDYPEMGLCIIINNKNFHKSTGMTSRSGTDVDAANLRETFRNLKYEVRNKNDLTREEIVELMRDVSKEDHSKRSSFVCVLLSHGEEGIIFGTNGPVDLKKITNFFRGDRCRSLTGKPKLFIIQACRGTELDCGIETDSGVDDDMACHKIPVEADFLYAYSTAPGYYSWRNSKDGSWFIQSLCAMLKQYADKLEFMHILTRVNRKVATEFESFSFDATFHAKKQIPCIVSMLTKELYFYH","tissue_eye":3.291955,"tissue_saliva":2.523739,"compartment_extracellular":3.589453,"tissue_adrenal gland":3.312566,"tissue_heart":3.807472,"tissue_muscle":3.734408,"stringdb_database identifier":"9606.ENSP00000311032","stringdb_namespace":"stringdb","tissue_intestine":3.885086,"tissue_kidney":3.684063,"stringdb_canonical name":"P42574","tissue_liver":3.807795,"tissue_pancreas":3.348605,"compartment_cytoskeleton":3.53383,"compartment_nucleus":5.0,"node_color":[0, 163, 255],"node_label":"CASP3","name":"9606.ENSP00000311032","node_Cytoscape_pos":[105.60347669601441, -15.715310668945335, 0.0],"tissue_lung":3.87934,"compartment_cytosol":5.0,"tissue_skin":3.458302,"tissue_urine":2.718635,"stringdb_species":"Homo sapiens","tissue_spleen":3.428588,"compartment_golgi apparatus":2.345717,"compartment_endoplasmic reticulum":3.397492,"shared name":"9606.ENSP00000311032","tissue_stomach":3.464727,"SUID":435,"tissue_blood":4.815772,"@id":"stringdb:9606.ENSP00000311032","compartment_mitochondrion":4.324545,"node_size":35.0,"stringdb_enhancedLabel Passthrough":"label: attribute=\"display name\" labelsize=12 labelAlignment=left outline=true outlineColor=white outlineTransparency=95 outlineWidth=10 background=false color=black dropShadow=false","stringdb_node type":"protein","compartment_endosome":2.578504,"stringdb_description":"Caspase 3, apoptosis-related cysteine peptidase; Involved in the activation cascade of caspases responsible for apoptosis execution.

The C9orf72-SMCR8 complex also acts as a regulator of autophagy initiation by interacting with the ATG1\/ULK1 kinase complex and modulating its protein kinase activity. Positively regulates initiation of autophagy by regulating the RAB1A-dependent trafficking of the ATG1\/ULK1 kinase complex to the phagophore which leads to autophagosome formation. Acts as a regulator of mTORC1 signaling by promoting phosphorylation of mTORC1 substrates. Plays a role in endosomal trafficking. May be involved in regulating the maturation of phagosomes to lysosomes (By similarity). Regulates actin dynamics in motor neurons by inhibiting the GTP-binding activity of ARF6, leading to ARF6 inactivation. This reduces the activity of the LIMK1 and LIMK2 kinases which are responsible for phosphorylation and inactivation of cofilin, leading to cofilin activation.

May mediate calcium-dependent regulation on many physiological processes by interacting with other proteins, such as TPR-containing proteins, and modulating their activity; Belongs to the S-100 family.","display name":"S100B","stringdb_structures":["1MQ1","1UWO","2H61","2M49","2PRU","3CZT","3D0Y","3D10","3HCM","4XYN","5CSF","5CSI","5CSJ","5CSN","5D7F"],"tissue_thyroid gland":1.721575,"compartment_peroxisome":1.024613,"target_family":"","tissue_bone marrow":2.043641,"target_development level":"Tchem","compartment_lysosome":1.880227,"tissue_nervous system":4.881657,"compartment_plasma membrane":2.518844,"tissue_bone":2.219903},"327":{"tissue_gall bladder":1.263241,"stringdb_disease score":4.36178,"stringdb_sequence":"MSGGGPSGGGPGGSGRARTSSFAEPGGGGGGGGGGPGGSASGPGGTGGGKASVGAMGGGVGASSSGGGPGGSGGGGSGGPGAGTSFPPPGVKLGRDSGKVTTVVATLGQGPERSQEVAYTDIKVIGNGSFGVVYQARLAETRELVAIKKVLQDKRFKNRELQIMRKLDHCNIVRLRYFFYSSGEKKDELYLNLVLEYVPETVYRVARHFTKAKLTIPILYVKVYMYQLFRSLAYIHSQGVCHRDIKPQNLLVDPDTAVLKLCDFGSAKQLVRGEPNVSYICSRYYRAPELIFGATDYTSSIDVWSAGCVLAELLLGQPIFPGDSGVDQLVEIIKVLGTPTREQIREMNPNYTEFKFPQIKAHPWTKVFKSRTPPEAIALCSSLLEYTPSSRLSPLEACAHSFFDELRCLGTQLPNNRPLPPLFNFSAGELSIQPSLNAILIPPHLRSPAGTTTLTPSSQALTETPTSSDWQSTDATPTLTNSS","tissue_eye":4.303996,"tissue_saliva":1.238882,"compartment_extracellular":1.622977,"tissue_adrenal gland":1.965002,"tissue_heart":2.633175,"tissue_muscle":3.372484,"stringdb_database identifier":"9606.ENSP00000222330","stringdb_namespace":"stringdb","tissue_intestine":3.119708,"tissue_kidney":2.916295,"stringdb_canonical name":"P49840","tissue_liver":4.552391,"tissue_pancreas":4.42534,"compartment_cytoskeleton":1.790518,"compartment_nucleus":4.428932,"node_color":[255, 0, 122],"node_label":"GSK3A","name":"9606.ENSP00000222330","node_Cytoscape_pos":[-59.226692981719964, -418.6029754638672, 0.0],"tissue_lung":2.65297,"compartment_cytosol":4.41271,"tissue_skin":2.291275,"tissue_urine":1.302475,"stringdb_species":"Homo sapiens","tissue_spleen":2.065403,"compartment_golgi apparatus":0.845185,"compartment_endoplasmic reticulum":1.231406,"shared name":"9606.ENSP00000222330","tissue_stomach":2.050649,"SUID":327,"tissue_blood":2.44656,"@id":"stringdb:9606.ENSP00000222330","compartment_mitochondrion":3.808301,"node_size":35.0,"stringdb_enhancedLabel Passthrough":"label: attribute=\"display name\" labelsize=12 labelAlignment=left outline=true outlineColor=white outlineTransparency=95 outlineWidth=10 background=false color=black dropShadow=false","stringdb_node type":"protein","compartment_endosome":0.844017,"stringdb_description":"Serine\/threonine-protein kinase GSK3A; Constitutively active protein kinase that acts as a negative regulator in the hormonal control of glucose homeostasis, Wnt signaling and regulation of transcription factors and microtubules, by phosphorylating and inactivating glycogen synthase (GYS1 or GYS2), CTNNB1\/beta-catenin, APC and AXIN1. Requires primed phosphorylation of the majority of its substrates. Contributes to insulin regulation of glycogen synthesis by phosphorylating and inhibiting GYS1 activity and hence glycogen synthesis. Regulates glycogen metabolism in liver, but not in muscle. May also mediate the development of insulin resistance by regulating activation of transcription factors. In Wnt signaling, regulates the level and transcriptional activity of nuclear CTNNB1\/beta-catenin. Facilitates amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and the generation of APP-derived amyloid plaques found in Alzheimer disease. May be involved in the regulation of replication in pancreatic beta-cells. Is necessary for the establishment of neuronal polarity and axon outgrowth. Through phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL1, may control cell apoptosis in response to growth factors deprivation; Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily.

Alternatively can also bind NTF3\/neurotrophin-3 which is less efficient in activating the receptor but regulates neuron survival through NTRK2. Upon ligand-binding, undergoes homodimerization, autophosphorylation and activation. Recruits, phosphorylates and\/or activates several downstream effectors including SHC1, FRS2, SH2B1, SH2B2 and PLCG1 that regulate distinct overlapping signaling cascades. Through SHC1, FRS2, SH2B1, SH2B2 activates the GRB2-Ras-MAPK cascade that regulates for instance neuronal differentiation including neurite outgrowth. Through the same effectors controls the Ras-PI3 kinase-AKT1 signaling cascade that mainly regulates growth and survival. Through PLCG1 and the downstream protein kinase C-regulated pathways controls synaptic plasticity. Thereby, plays a role in learning and memory by regulating both short term synaptic function and long-term potentiation. PLCG1 also leads to NF-Kappa-B activation and the transcription of genes involved in cell survival.

In response to pathogens and other damage-associated signals, initiates the formation of the inflammasome polymeric complex, made of NLRP3, PYCARD and CASP1 (and possibly CASP4 and CASP5). Recruitment of proCASP1 to the inflammasome promotes its activation and CASP1- catalyzed IL1B and IL18 maturation and secretion in the extracellular milieu. Activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is also required for HMGB1 secretion. The active cytokines and HMGB1 stimulate inflammatory responses. Inflammasomes can also induce pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of programmed cell death. Under resting conditions, NLRP3 is autoinhibited. NLRP3 activation stimuli include extracellular ATP, reactive oxygen species, K(+) efflux, crystals of monosodium urate or cholesterol, amyloid-beta fibers, environmental or industrial particles and nanoparticles, etc. However, it is unclear what constitutes the direct NLRP3 activator. Independently of inflammasome activation, regulates the differentiation of T helper 2 (Th2) cells and has a role in Th2 cell-dependent asthma and tumor growth (By similarity).
